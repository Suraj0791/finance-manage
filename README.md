## 🗄️ Database Management & Supabase Free Tier

### Handling Database Pausing

This application includes robust handling for Supabase free tier database pausing:

- **Automatic Detection**: The app detects when the database is paused due to 7 days of inactivity
- **Wake-Up Functionality**: Built-in database wake-up feature with progress tracking
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed connections
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear error messages explaining the free tier limitations
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time database status monitoring on the dashboard

### Why Database Pausing Happens

- Supabase free tier automatically pauses databases after 7 days of inactivity
- This is a cost-saving and resource management measure
- Your data is safe and the database will resume when accessed
- Common error: Prisma P1001 "Can't reach database server"

### Preventing Database Pausing

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Included workflow pings the database every 6 days
2. **Health Check Endpoints**: `/api/health` and `/api/ping` for monitoring
3. **Manual Wake-Up**: Users can manually wake up the database through the UI

### Connection String Optimizations

```env
# Enhanced connection string with timeouts for Supabase free tier
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=60&pool_timeout=60"
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. **Environment Variables**: Set all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application
4. **Update APP_URL**: Set your production URL in environment variables
5. **GitHub Actions**: The included workflow will keep your database active

### Manual Deployment Steps

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

### Post-Deployment Setup

1. Update `APP_URL` environment variable with your deployed URL
2. Add the deployed URL to GitHub Secrets as `APP_URL` for database ping workflow
3. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
4. Test the database wake-up functionality

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: `Prisma P1001: Can't reach database server`
**Solution**:

- This typically happens when Supabase free tier database is paused
- Use the built-in database wake-up feature in the app
- Wait 1-2 minutes for the database to fully wake up
- The app includes automatic retry logic

#### Receipt Scanning Not Working

**Problem**: Receipt scanning fails or returns empty results
**Solution**:

- Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct
- Ensure the image is clear and well-lit
- Check that the receipt text is clearly visible
- Try uploading a different image format (JPG, PNG)

#### Email Notifications Not Sending

**Problem**: Budget alerts or group invitations not sending
**Solution**:

- Verify your `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid
- Check that your domain is verified in Resend
- Ensure email templates are properly configured
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

#### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Sign-in/sign-up not working
**Solution**:

- Verify Clerk API keys are correct
- Check that redirect URLs match your environment
- Ensure Clerk webhook endpoints are properly configured
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### Database Management

#### Preventing Database Pausing

- The included GitHub Actions workflow pings the database every 6 days
- Manual health checks are available at `/api/health`
- Database status is monitored in real-time on the dashboard

#### Backup and Recovery

```bash
# Create a database backup (PostgreSQL)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

# Restore from backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Performance

- Connection pooling is enabled by default
- Retry logic handles temporary connection issues
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

#### Client-Side Performance

- Server components reduce client-side JavaScript
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Components are lazy-loaded where appropriate
